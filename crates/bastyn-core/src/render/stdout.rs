//! Terminal rendering.
//!
//! The report reads top to bottom as the answer to four questions, in the
//! order a reader asks them: what ran, what the verdict is, what to fix, and
//! what the scan did not see.
//!
//! Defects are grouped by [`Layer`] and printed in the order an attack runs —
//! entry vectors, amplifiers, impacts, then the threats that span rings — and
//! the missing defenses close the list. A flat list by file answers "what is
//! wrong"; this ordering answers "what first", because the top section is the
//! one whose fixes make the sections below it unreachable. Within a section
//! the worst severity comes first: the file a finding lives in is on the
//! finding's own header line, so grouping by file would only add a level of
//! nesting that pushes a critical below a high.
//!
//! Observations follow in their own, visibly quieter section and are never
//! ranked among the layers, however their categories map — an observation is a
//! control the repository cannot show is actually missing, and giving it a
//! place in a priority order would be claiming otherwise. When they were not
//! collected the report says how many are being withheld and which flag shows
//! them; it never says "no observations" while the summary counts three.
//!
//! Coverage gaps are always printed, even when nothing was skipped and even
//! when no CVE lookup ran: a reader must never read "no CVEs listed" as "no
//! CVEs exist". The compliance crosswalk and the summary close it out.
