//! Container configuration inspection.
//!
//! ZT3 — no sandbox boundary, unrestricted filesystem or network reach — is
//! close to undetectable in application source, because the boundary is not
//! expressed there. It *is* expressed, mechanically and unambiguously, in
//! container configuration, which is why this module exists and why it is not
//! a set of rules in `bastyn.yml`.
//!
//! Scope is Dockerfiles and Docker Compose, and nothing else. Of 65 real
//! third-party AI repositories we measured, 38% carry a Dockerfile; Terraform
//! appears in three of them and genuine Kubernetes manifests total 21 files
//! across the whole corpus. Support for those is not here because the evidence
//! does not yet ask for it.
//!
//! # Checks
//!
//! | Rule | What it flags | Kind | Category |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `BAS-INFRA-001` | `USER root` as the effective final user | defect | `ZT3` |
//! | `BAS-INFRA-001` | No `USER` instruction at all | observation | `ZT3` |
//! | `BAS-INFRA-002` | A provider API key literal in `ENV` or `ARG` | defect | `ZT1` |
//! | `BAS-INFRA-003` | A volume mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` | defect | `ZT3` |
//! | `BAS-INFRA-004` | `privileged: true` | defect | `ZT3` |
//! | `BAS-INFRA-005` | `network_mode: host` | observation | `ZT3` |
//! | `BAS-INFRA-006` | A hardcoded password/secret/token in `ENV`/`ARG` or Compose `environment:` | defect | `ZT1` |
//! | `BAS-INFRA-010` | `pid: host` | observation | `ZT3` |
//!
//! # ZT3.1 and ZT3.2 are mostly already here
//!
//! The rule catalogue's ZT3.1 ("a code-exec sandbox container runs
//! `privileged: true`") and ZT3.2 ("an MCP/agent container bind-mounts the
//! Docker socket or shares the host network/PID namespace") describe checks
//! that, for the most part, already existed here before those catalogue
//! entries were written: `BAS-INFRA-004` fires on `privileged: true`
//! unconditionally (not narrowed to services classified as "a sandbox",
//! which is a strictly stronger signal than the catalogue asks for), and
//! `BAS-INFRA-003`/`BAS-INFRA-005` already cover the Docker-socket and
//! host-network halves of ZT3.2. `BAS-INFRA-010` closes the one gap that was
//! left: the host PID namespace.
//!
//! # Why two kinds under one rule id
//!
//! Most Dockerfiles in the wild carry no `USER` instruction: 35 of the 57 the
//! scan reaches in our calibration corpus. Reporting each one as a defect
//! would be the exact noise this scanner exists to avoid, and it would drown
//! the one case that is unambiguous — a Dockerfile that explicitly ends as
//! root. So absence is an observation, hidden unless asked for, and an
//! explicit choice of root is a defect.
//!
//! The same line separates `BAS-INFRA-004` from `BAS-INFRA-005`: a privileged
//! container and a mounted Docker socket are escapes in every deployment,
//! while sharing the host network stack is how a sidecar is normally run.
