//! Compiling loaded rules into matchers, and running them over source.
//!
//! # Multi-language dispatch
//!
//! `ast_grep_core`'s [`Pattern`] and [`RegexMatcher`] are both language-erased
//! *once compiled*: neither type carries a `Language` type parameter, so
//! nothing at the type level stops a `Pattern` compiled against one grammar
//! from being handed to [`ast_grep_core::matcher::MatcherExt::find_all`] on a
//! tree parsed with a *different* grammar. A `Pattern`'s internal node-kind
//! ids are meaningful only relative to the grammar it was compiled with;
//! comparing them against another grammar's tree would silently compare
//! unrelated numbers; not a compile error, not a panic, just wrong answers.
//!
//! [`RuleSet`] therefore keeps one compiled bucket of [`CompiledRule`] per
//! grammar (`python`, `javascript`, `typescript`, `tsx`) and [`scan_source`]
//! picks the bucket that matches the file's grammar *before* handing any
//! pattern to a tree. A rule is never even tried against a file whose
//! grammar it was not compiled for.
//!
//! The actual matching logic ([`scan_with`]) is written once, generic over
//! `L: LanguageExt + Copy`, rather than duplicated per language: `Pattern`,
//! `RegexMatcher`, `Any<Pattern>`, and `Node::{find_all,matches,inside}` are
//! all already generic over the document type, so the only place a concrete
//! language actually has to be named is where a [`Pattern`] or an
//! [`AstGrep`] tree is constructed.
//!
//! ## Why TypeScript rules compile twice
//!
//! `ast-grep-language` ships TypeScript and Tsx as two distinct
//! `tree-sitter` grammars (`tree-sitter-typescript`'s `LANGUAGE_TYPESCRIPT`
//! and `LANGUAGE_TSX`), each with its own node-kind table. They are close
//! enough that most everyday code parses identically under both, but they
//! are not guaranteed to agree, and in at least one case they concretely do
//! not: TypeScript's angle-bracket type assertion (`<Foo>bar`) parses to a
//! `type_assertion` node under the TypeScript grammar and to an `ERROR` node
//! under the Tsx grammar (JSX's `<Foo>` opening-tag syntax wins the
//! ambiguity). A `Pattern` compiled once against TypeScript and reused
//! against a Tsx tree would be trusting that every node-kind id it captured
//! happens to line up in a grammar it was never compiled against -- exactly
//! the class of silent mismatch this module exists to avoid.
//!
//! So a `language: typescript` rule in `bastyn.yml` is compiled twice, once
//! per grammar, in [`RuleSet::from_yaml`]: once against
//! [`ast_grep_language::TypeScript`] for `.ts`/`.cts`/`.mts` files, and once
//! against [`ast_grep_language::Tsx`] for `.tsx` files. Both compiles must
//! succeed for the rule to load -- if a pattern only parses under one
//! grammar, that is a real authoring bug the rule author needs to fix, not a
//! gap to paper over silently. There is deliberately no `RuleLanguage::Tsx`
//! variant in the schema: a rule author writes `language: typescript` once,
//! and covering `.tsx` is this module's job, not theirs. `RuleSet::len`
//! counts such a rule once, not twice; see its doc comment.
//!
//! ## Why JavaScript rules compile three times
//!
//! The same argument runs one step further, in one direction only.
//! JavaScript is a syntactic subset of TypeScript: every construct a
//! `language: javascript` pattern can describe is equally valid in a `.ts`
//! or `.tsx` file, so such a rule is compiled against all three grammars and
//! lands in all three buckets.
//!
//! Routing it to the JavaScript bucket alone was a silent coverage hole:
//! `eval($ARG)` written as a JavaScript rule scanned `.js` and skipped the
//! byte-identical `.ts` file beside it, with no error, no warning, and
//! nothing in the report to say one file had been scanned by fewer rules
//! than its neighbour. That is precisely the class of quiet mismatch this
//! per-grammar dispatch exists to prevent, so it is now pinned by
//! `a_javascript_rule_also_fires_on_typescript_and_tsx_files`.
//!
//! The subset relationship does not run the other way, and the dispatch must
//! not pretend it does. TypeScript-only syntax (`x satisfies T`, `interface`,
//! a type annotation) is not valid JavaScript, so a `language: typescript`
//! rule stays out of the JavaScript bucket -- pinned by
//! `a_typescript_rule_does_not_fire_on_javascript_files`.
//!
//! `RegexMatcher` (used for `metavariable_matches`) needs none of this: it
//! matches on a captured node's *text*, not its structure, so one compiled
//! regex is reused across every language a rule targets.
//!
//! # One traversal per file, not one per rule
//!
//! [`Node::find_all`] is `dfs().filter_map(..)`: calling it once per rule
//! walks the whole tree once per rule. With 21 Python rules loaded, plus the
//! separate `dfs()` that looks for parse errors, a Python file used to be
//! walked 22 times. Measured on a 250k-line repository, tree-cursor movement
//! (`ts_tree_cursor_*`) was 64% of the process's samples against 27% for
//! tree-sitter parsing itself — the scanner spent more than twice as long
//! re-walking trees as it did building them.
//!
//! [`scan_with`] therefore drives one [`Node::dfs`] itself and offers each
//! node to every rule, folding the parse-error check into the same pass. The
//! per-node work is unchanged: [`Node::find_all`]'s kind pre-filter is
//! reproduced by [`CompiledRule::can_match_kind`], and the matcher it calls
//! for a surviving node is the same [`ast_grep_core::matcher::MatcherExt::match_node`]
//! on the same [`Any`], so the same nodes match in the same order.
