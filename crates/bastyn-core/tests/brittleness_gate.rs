//! Measures how much of each `metavariable_matches` naming gate's precision
//! is bought at the cost of recall against realistically-named code.
//!
//! `bastyn.yml` buys a lot of its precision with a regex gate on a captured
//! variable's *name* -- `eval($ARG)` only fires when `$ARG`'s text looks like
//! `response`/`reply`/`completion`/... A gate like that is exactly as good as
//! its assumption that real code names things that way, and that assumption
//! was never measured, only asserted. A calibration run over 65 real
//! third-party AI repositories (2026-08-28) already showed the
//! consequence for two rules by contrast: BAS-LLM10-005 went from "never
//! fired" to firing repeatedly the moment its `ARG` gate was dropped, while
//! BAS-LLM10-007's gate stayed because dropping it would have traded 0
//! findings for 7 false positives on `${table}`-shaped interpolations. This
//! file turns that kind of one-off measurement into a permanent, per-rule
//! number, for every naming gate in the file, so the next such decision has
//! evidence instead of a hunch.
//!
//! # What counts as a "naming gate"
//!
//! Not every `metavariable_matches` entry gates a *name*. `BAS-ZT1-001`'s
//! `SECRET` regex (`^sk-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{16,}$`) and `BAS-ZT1-002`'s `VALUE`
//! regex test the *shape of a string's own content* -- a real API key still
//! looks like `sk-...` no matter what variable holds it, so renaming the
//! variable cannot defeat that gate and there is nothing to measure. The
//! gates this file exercises are the ones where the regex is tested against
//! the text of an *identifier* -- a variable, parameter, receiver, or
//! function/binding name -- because that is exactly the kind of gate a
//! developer's naming choice can accidentally walk around. `BAS-LLM08-001`'s
//! `VAR` gate (an identifier) is covered; its `CONTENT` gate (a secret's own
//! shape) is not, for the same reason.
//!
//! # Where the realistic names came from
//!
//! Per the task brief, the "real-world synonym" word lists below were
//! harvested by grepping the calibration corpus (65 real third-party AI
//! repositories, kept in a separate private repository and never committed
//! here) for the actual variable names
//! real code binds to a model reply and to an `eval`/`exec` argument --
//! things like `content`, `text`, `statement`, `code`, `expression`,
//! `resolved`. Nothing from that corpus is reproduced verbatim here: every
//! sample below is a synthetic snippet this file authored, using only the
//! *names* (paraphrased where a corpus name was itself gate-shaped, e.g.
//! `page_content` still contains `content`) against a vulnerability shape
//! this file also authored. That is what makes committing this file safe,
//! and is why the corpus itself is not committed here at all.
//!
//! # Method
//!
//! For each `(rule, gated variable)` pair, one source template holds every
//! *other* part of the match fixed (including any other gated variable, held
//! at a value that satisfies its own gate) and substitutes one name at a time
//! for the variable under test, drawn from three groups:
//!
//! - `in_gate`: words the regex explicitly lists. Every one must fire against
//!   the real, shipped rule -- if it does not, the regex itself is broken,
//!   not just narrow.
//! - `synonyms`: realistic names for the same value that the regex does not
//!   list. What fraction of these the shipped rule still catches is the
//!   headline brittleness number: **real-world survival rate**.
//! - `unrelated`: a value that genuinely is not the thing the rule is about.
//!   For a naming gate that is a name for something else (a config path, a
//!   table name, a retry count), because the name is what the gate reads.
//!   None of these should fire against the shipped rule; if one does, the
//!   "genuinely unrelated" classification was wrong, or the regex is looser
//!   than intended -- either way this test catches it, because `Target`'s
//!   templates and `scan_source` run the *actual* compiled rule, not a
//!   re-implementation of it.
//!
//! # Rules that gate on provenance
//!
//! A rule that has migrated to a `flow:` clause is measured the same way, but
//! two things about its fixture have to change, and both changes make the
//! measurement stricter rather than kinder.
//!
//! **Its template has to contain the whole vulnerability.** `BAS-LLM10-001`'s
//! template was `eval(__ARG__)` -- one line, with no model call anywhere in
//! the file. That is not "model output executed as code" written with a
//! different variable name; it is a snippet in which the *name is the only
//! evidence there is*, which is precisely the assumption the file exists to
//! test. Any rule that fires on it fires by guessing. So the template for a
//! provenance-gated rule binds the name from a model call and then uses it,
//! and the name still varies exactly as before:
//!
//! ```python
//! def handle(ticket):
//!     __ARG__ = client.chat.completions.create(prompt=ticket).choices[0].message.content
//!     eval(__ARG__)
//! ```
//!
//! **Its `unrelated` control has to vary the value, not the name.** Under a
//! provenance gate the name decides nothing, so `eval(config_path)` proves
//! nothing about precision: it would pass whatever the rule did. The control
//! that means something is the mirror image -- hold the name at the most
//! gate-shaped words this file has (`response`, `completion`, `output`) and
//! make the *value* innocent, here a `json.load` of a file. A rule that fires
//! on those is guessing from the name, and this file fails. That is a
//! materially harder bar than the naming-gate control it replaces, where
//! `eval(config_path)` staying silent was true by construction.
//!
//! Both changes are recorded here rather than left implicit because they move
//! a published number: the overall survival rate below is not comparable
//! across them for the migrated row. `BAS-LLM10-001` scored 0% on the old
//! template both before and after its migration -- the old fixture cannot
//! distinguish the two rules at all, which is the point.
//!
//! Each sample is run twice: once against `RuleSet::embedded()` (the shipped,
//! gated rule -- what the three bullet points above measure), and once
//! against a *widened* variant compiled from the same `any`/`none`/`inside`
//! patterns with only that variable's gate removed -- its
//! `metavariable_matches` entry, or its `flow:` clause (built by editing
//! `bastyn.yml`'s own parsed YAML in memory, so it
//! can never drift from the rule it is testing -- see
//! [`widened_ruleset_without`]). The widened run answers a different
//! question than the three headline numbers: not "does the shipped rule
//! catch this", but "if this gate were dropped the way BAS-LLM10-005's was,
//! would the rule still be precise". A rule with a high real-world miss rate
//! *and* zero widened false-fires on `unrelated` is a safe widening
//! candidate; a rule that fires on `unrelated` once widened is not -- that is
//! the BAS-LLM10-007 case, reproduced here as a number instead of a story.
//!
//! # What this file intentionally does not do
//!
//! It does not touch `rules/bastyn.yml` or `src/rules/`. It measures; fixing
//! a specific gate is a separate decision with its own precision trade-off,
//! made against the 65-repository corpus and recorded in `bastyn.yml` beside
//! the rule (see BAS-LLM10-007's comment for a widening that was measured and
//! refused, and BAS-LLM10-001's for a migration that was measured and taken).
