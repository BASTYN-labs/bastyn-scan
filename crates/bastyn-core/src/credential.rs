//!
//! Originally written for `BAS-INFRA-006` (used by both the Dockerfile
//! `ENV`/`ARG` and Docker Compose `environment:` checks -- one judgment,
//! applied in two file formats, rather than two independently-drifting
//! heuristics), and promoted from `infra::credential` to this crate-root
//! module so the generic hardcoded-credential rules in `rules/secrets.yml`
//! (`BAS-ZT1-010`/`BAS-ZT1-011`) can be authored, and checked in tests,
//! against the exact same word lists rather than a hand-drifted YAML-regex
//! copy. The YAML rule engine has no way to call this code at match time --
//! `metavariable_matches`/`metavariable_not_matches` are plain regexes -- so
//! the reuse is: this module's constants are the source of truth, the YAML
//! regexes are a hand-checked translation of them (see the comment above
//! `BAS-ZT1-010` in `rules/secrets.yml`), and `tests_secrets.rs` asserts the
//! two agree on the same value vectors these functions' own tests use.
